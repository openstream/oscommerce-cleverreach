CleverReach osCommerce Add-On (compatible with osCommerce 2.3.1)

This osCommerce Add-On syncs an osCommerce customer's gender, first name, last name and e-mail address to CleverReach (via CleverReach API) if the newsletter subscription checkbox is checked. 

The following osCommerce files need to be either overwritten or if they are not equal to the ones in osCommerce 2.3.1, they have to be manually edited:

1. create_account.php
2. account_edit.php
3. account_newsletter.php
4. admin/customers.php

Those 4 files are included in this package along with a modified application_top.php and a new CleverReach function file.
